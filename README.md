# NULLWOOD: Black Tree Pattern Generator

> *"Visualizing the microscopic essence and energy flow of the 'Black Trees' inhabiting the Nullwood universe."*

**NULLWOOD** is a generative art project constructed by artist **SHHAN**, visualizing a purgatorial virtual space known as **'Black Lake No.01'**.

In this world, the falling stars are not celestial bodies, but the **fragmenting memories and data of individual human lives**. Each star's silent descent marks the precise moment of death in the real world, registering the end of one life cycle into the system.

## 🌲 Project Overview

This repository hosts the **Black Tree Pattern Generator**, a web-based generative art tool.

The **'Black Trees'** of Nullwood stand as silent archivists, absorbing these falling data-stars. They are not biological entities but complex data structures. This generator peels back the surface of these entities, algorithmically reconstructing their **inner texture**—the dark grain, cellular density, and the rhythmic flow of stored consciousness.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Generative Algorithms:** Utilizes advanced 4D noise and flow field algorithms to create non-repeating, organic textures (Wood grain, Water flow, Knots).
* **Dual Modes:**
    * **Monochrome:** The classic Nullwood aesthetic (Black/Grey/White).
    * **Hokusai Color:** Randomly applied palettes inspired by Japanese woodblock prints (The Great Wave, Red Fuji, etc.).
* **Real-time Customization:** Adjustable width and height scales (1x to 5x) with instant preview.
* **High-Resolution Export:** Support for saving patterns as **PNG** images or vector **SVG** files for further artistic use.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean, glassmorphism-inspired interface that focuses on the artwork.
